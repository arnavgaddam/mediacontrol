###  Web-based application to control currently playing media on a windows machine. 
The application uses the winsdk python library instead of microsoft's winrt library since it is no longer support by newer versions of python. The library allows the currently playing media on a windows computer to be queried and controlled from code. The original intent of this application was to be used on a mobile device while away from your computer to control whatever media is playing. However, since it runs on the web rather than being a standalone app, the player can also be used on other devices that can connect to the internet, including things like TVs and game consoles. Note: the app only works with two devices connected to the same network.
